# Blocky Chess Engine

Blocky is a UCI-compliant chess engine. Given that Blocky is currently a new engine, there aren't too many features and techniques yet to make this engine strong. The following are the ones that we have implemented: 

* Alpha-beta search with fail-soft
* Bitboards
* Zobrist-Hashing
